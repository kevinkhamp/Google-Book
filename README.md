## Installation

https://github.com/shimpfierie/Google-Book

## Usage

Clone/fork the repo and deploy it in Heroku via connecting to your GitHub account. There is currently an issue with React Router that was posted yesterday. I do not know if that issue has been resolved or not. I cannot guarantee that it will deploy or not. Discretion is advised.

Running via ```npm run develop``` is highly recommended.
